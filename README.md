# 🔐 Wireshark Network Traffic Analysis

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates the capture and analysis of live network traffic using **Wireshark**. The objective is to understand how data flows across a network and to identify commonly used network protocols.

This project was completed as part of a **Cyber Security Internship** to gain hands-on experience in network traffic monitoring and protocol analysis.

## 🔍 Methodology
1. Installed Wireshark on the system.
2. Selected the active Wi-Fi network interface.
3. Captured live network traffic.
4. Generated traffic by browsing websites and using the ping command.
5. Stopped the capture after collecting sufficient packets.
6. Applied protocol filters to analyze network communication.
7. Saved the captured traffic in `.pcap` format.
8. Documented findings in a report.
